 we performed
 -Exploratory data analysis
 -Preprocessing of text
 -univariate analysis
 -Machine learning models like naive bayes, KNN ,Logistic regression,linear support vector machines,Random forest classifier
 -feature engineering
 
 #observations
1. Best model: liner model(logistic regression) with class balancing
2. Best featuriser: tfidf bigram on Text feature
3. Model interpretability: good
4. model complexity : good
5. Best Result using best model with optimum hyperparameter: train loss=0.38, CV loss=0.94,
   test_loss=0.95.
